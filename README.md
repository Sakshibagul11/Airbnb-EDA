### 🌍 Airbnb EDA Project — Exploratory Data Analysis

---


## ✨📌 Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb dataset to understand:

How pricing varies by location

Which room types are most popular

What factors make a listing more expensive

Host activity patterns

Availability trends

Neighborhood-wise insights

The goal is to find hidden patterns that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions

## 🎯 Objectives
✔️ Clean and process Airbnb data

✔️ Perform univariate & bivariate analysis

✔️ Understand pricing behaviour

✔️ Visualize patterns using interactive & static plots

✔️ Provide business insights for hosts & customers

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Remove duplicates

Handle missing values

Convert price columns to numerical

Remove outliers

Format dates & categories

Create useful new features

## 📊 Data Visualizations

Pairplot: To see correlations among price, availability, and number of reviews.

Heatmap: Showing correlations among numerical features.

Histograms and Boxplots: To detect outliers in price.

Bar Charts: Displaying room types and neighborhood group distributions

## 🚀 Key Findings and Insights

1]  📈 Price Trends

💰 Manhattan has the most expensive listings, followed by Brooklyn.

🏠 Entire homes/apartments cost significantly more than private or shared rooms.

2]  🏡 Room Type Distribution

🏘️ Entire homes/apartments are the most common listing type.

🛏️ Private rooms offer budget-friendly options for travelers.

3]  ⚠️ Outliers in Price

🚨 Detected a few listings priced at $10,000+.

🧹 Indicates the need to remove/handle extreme outliers for accurate analysis.

4]  📅 Availability Patterns

📉 Listings with higher availability tend to have lower prices.

⭐ Such listings often receive more reviews, likely due to better guest experience and affordability.


## 🔮 Future Work

🤖 Use machine learning models to predict prices based on room type, location, and other features.

💬 Perform sentiment analysis on guest reviews to understand customer satisfaction and experience.

📊 Create an interactive dashboard using Plotly, Streamlit, or Tableau for real-time visualization and monitoring of Airbnb trends.
